# What I Learned

* Server-side rendering: Create a dynamic web server that leverages server-side rendering by generating HTML dynamically on the server before sending it to the client.
* Data representation: Write JavaScript that represents data in both in text form and visually, through graphs and charts.
* Database integration: Integrate a database with a web server to store and retrieve data.
* Error handling: Send proper 404 errors with custom error messages to the user.
